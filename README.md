# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest and XGBoost

This Colab notebook demonstrates the implementation of credit card fraud detection using two popular machine learning models:

1. **Random Forest**
2. **XGBoost**

**Dataset:**

* The notebook utilizes a publicly available credit card fraud dataset (you can find it on Kaggle or other sources). 
* The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
* The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.

**Features:**

* The dataset includes numerous anonymized features (V1-V28) generated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for security and privacy reasons. 
* Time and Amount features are also included.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    * Load the dataset.
    * Handle class imbalance using techniques like:
        * **Oversampling (SMOTE):** Generate synthetic samples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
        * **Undersampling:** Reduce the number of samples in the majority class.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
    * Train the Random Forest and XGBoost models on the training data.
    * Tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the performance of both models on the test set using metrics such as:
        * **Accuracy**
        * **Precision**
        * **Recall**
        * **F1-score**
        * **ROC AUC**
        * **Confusion Matrix**

4. **Model Comparison:**
    * Compare the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost to determine the best-performing model.

**Key Findings:**

* [Insert key findings from your analysis here, e.g., XGBoost achieved the highest AUC score, SMOTE improved performance for Random Forest, etc.]

**Conclusion:**

This notebook demonstrates the application of machine learning models for credit card fraud detection. The results highlight the importance of handling class imbalance and the potential of models like XGBoost for achieving high accuracy in fraud detection tasks.

**Further Improvements:**

* Explore more advanced techniques for handling class imbalance (e.g., anomaly detection).
* Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
* Deploy the model for real-time fraud detection.
